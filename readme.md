## OpenAPI Spec

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code, additional documentation, or network traffic inspection. 
- When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with minimal implementation logic.
